 and argc > 1), a call is made to set_semvalue to initialize the semaphore and op_char is
 set to X. */

/* Simple demo of using System V IPC semaphores.
 *
 * In principle, these semaphores are just like those from Ch 12: they provide
 * always-positive counters, with atomic access for incrementing and
 * decrementing, and the guarantee that a decrement, when you hit zero,
 * always blocks.
 *
 * As in Chapter 12, we will only think about the most common use case, which
 * is a binary semaphore used for locking.
 *
 * The api of System V semaphores is more complicated: you create a semaphore
 * and give it a length, so that a single semaphore struct can contain many
 * sempahores. This is useful because you don't want lots of global keys
 * floating around, but sometimes programs need to lock many different
 * resources, so you could create a semaphore of some larger size (maybe 4,
 * for 4 different files you want to lock).
 *
 * In this example though, we provide a simple 4 function wrapper around using
 * just a single semaphore for binary locking:
 *    set_semvalue
 *    del_semvalue
 *    semaphore_p
 *    semaphore_v
 *
 * To demo the program, start up two or more instances. Give the very first
 * one you start any cmdline argument. The main() function will interpret that
 * argument as an indication that this process should call set_semvalue(),
 * which initializes the semaphore with a value of 1 (unlocked).
 *
 * Then the processes will take turns running locked code, printing X in the
 * process that created the semaphore and O in the others.
 *
 * The process that created the sempahore deletes it before exiting. It's a
 * global resource in your computer, so this is very important!
